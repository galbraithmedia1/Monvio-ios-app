# Monviso Expo ios App

### Weather app for the Unita Mountains in Utah 

## Description

This app uses expo as the cli to connect to the app store. I programmed an esp32 to gather data from an DHT22, MQ-135 and BMP180 to gather temperature, humidity, altitude, barometric pressure, and air quality. I also designed and 3d printed a housing to store all the modules. This unit is connected to a starlink system.
